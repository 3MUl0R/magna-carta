# The Eight Ates

The culture we project is the culture we invite. As developers of a social platform, it is our duty to consciously cultivate a positive and mutually beneficial culture. These 8 principles encapsulate the ethos of Sansar as a company and we strongly encourage our community of creators and participants to adopt them, too.

# 1. Accommodate

Inclusivity and accessibility are core principles at Sansar. Everyone is welcomed and respected except those who refuse to welcome and respect others.

# 2. Appreciate
We practice gratitude, because our success is made possible by good fortune and the efforts of others as much as by our own efforts.

# 3. Stimulate
Sansar exists to offer people meaningful and impactful experiences; to encourage and reward curiosity.

# 4. Educate
Always be teaching, always be learning. Improve your own skills and those of others around you; stay open-minded.

# 5. Collaborate
When people work together, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—especially if they’re different from each other.

# 6. Innovate
We already know what happens when you do things the same way they’ve always been done, so let’s try new ways of doing things.

# 7. Iterate
Digital creations are living things that can and should be continually improved and optimized.

# 8. Mitigate
It’s not enough to do no harm, we must actively work to counteract things that cause harm.
