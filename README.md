# Sansar Magna Carta
The public laws of the Sansar Metaverse. You are hereby granted, free of charge and opression, the right and ability
to read, understand, and modify Sansarian law as you, the community, sees fit.

**These are *actual laws* that must be followed by yourself and moderators. This isn't an experiment.**

Please read these laws carefully and do your best to respect and honor them. Especially, do your best to change and
guard them from poor changes.

You cannot have an enforcement act applied to you unless these laws are followed, and you are allowed to make pull
requests to set the laws themselves. Esentially, you are your own judge, jury and executionor (execution as far as
executing an enforcement act, as violence is not ok).

## Please note
These laws are in their infancy. They will probably be changed a thousand times before they are stable, but like
all arcs, they are long, but bend towards justice.  Please help us get there, for your friends, family, community
and the future of humanity!
